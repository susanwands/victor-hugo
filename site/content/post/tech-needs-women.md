# Tech Needs Women

So if you are a woman, how would you design the perfect underwear **for a man**?

I mean, you could collect some data on average sizes of um ... content. 

You could ask some men about the common challenges with their current underwear.  

You could survey men with questions about comfort of fabrics, movement, durability, etc.

No matter how much data you gather, you as a woman, will never be able to fully understand exactly what it is like to use the product you produce, as a man. 

## We need your daily experience

If you are a woman, the majority of the products that you use on a daily basis are designed, implemented and tested by a man who can never truly understand your experience with them. 

Now that is no knock against men.  

For many of those decisions in design, great effort was likely taken to try to make it the best they could. They likely spent thousands of dollars and hours to make it awesome. 

The problem is there is only so close they can come to try and understand your real experience. Then they have to make assumptions. So next time the proportions of a product are all wrong or it seems awkward to you, it probably means they were missing your input. 

## What should we be asking?

If you never experince a problem personally, would you even think about trying to solve it? Most of us would just continue through life without ever thinking twice about it. The issues would never even occur to us at all. 

Imagine how different airplane travel might be if airlines consulted fat people.  Or how much better those hand soap dispensers would be if they tested on more ethnic skin tones.

Empathy is great, but it only gets you so far. You have to have something that raises the issue to your attention. Something that makes you notice an issue before you can ask, "How do we make this better?" or "How do we fix this?".

Diversity of genders, sizes, ethnicities and backgrounds creates better questions. It creates more diveristy in thinking, point-of-view and problem solving. 

## We need your point of view

Right now over half the world's population is women, but only a small fraction of technology jobs are filled by women. So the problems being solved are being directed by men.  What problems are we trying to solve... men are choosing.  How are we trying to solve them.... men are deciding.  

And that is not a knock on men, someone has to ask questions and solve problems. 

Women need to jump in and add their perspective to the industry. You are the missing piece of the puzzle.

Get in there lady ... the world needs you.
