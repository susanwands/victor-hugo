So eventually this will be my About page with tons of cool stuff about me.

I have some info about my journey into coding, and some encouraging words for other ladies trying to make it happen.

Likely add some info about what I hope to accomplish with LadyCoder as a site and a brand.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_LadyCoder).

Thanks for reading!
