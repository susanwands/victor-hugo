So I don't know if you have heard or not, but we have a little bit of an imbalance in the tech community regarding the number of women and minorities represented in the workplace. It can be a little isolating and disconcerting at times to be the "only one" on the team, in the department or at the event. I am typically a confident go-getter. I figure, if I can find it a bit intimidating at times, it might really be an issue.

The vision for LadyCoder is to be a haven for ladies who code. You can find helpful career advice, learning links and timely tech talks. There will be links to women-in-tech events and sites to keep you in the know. I hope to feature interviews, stories and advice from women in technology for inspiration. 






So eventually this will be my About page with tons of cool stuff about me.

I have some info about my journey into coding, and some encouraging words for other ladies trying to make it happen.

Likely add some info about what I hope to accomplish with LadyCoder as a site and a brand.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_LadyCoder).

Thanks for reading!
